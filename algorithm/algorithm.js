/* what is algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
(Ingredients) --> (Recipe) --> (Tasty dish)!


algorithm works as same of the above secuence.[(input) --> (algorithm) --> (output).  ]
algorithm is language independent.we can implement it with any type of language. */


//why algorithm?
//As a developer you're going to come accross problems that you need to solve.learning algorithm translates to learning different techniques to effciently solve those problems
//one problem can be solved in many ways using diffenrt algorithms.
//every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to perfonmance.


//algorithm analysis:
//there are multiple ways to solve one problem.
//so we sould go with the algorithm whice have the better performence..
//the absolute running time of an algorithm can not be predicted ,since it depends ona number of factors.


/* 1.programming language used to implement the algorithm.
2.the computer the program runs on.
3.other programs running at the same time.
4.quality of the oparating system.  */

//algorithm analysis contd:
//we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
//time complexity: amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
//space complexity: amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run,as a function of input size.
//by evaluating against the input size ,the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropiate.
