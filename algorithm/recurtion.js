//Recursion:
//Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solution to smaller instance of the same problem.

//recurtion is when a function call itself!


//why recurtion?
//a great technique to simplify your solution.
//if you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem,recursion is very usefull.


//Analogy: if principal asked to two proffessor for getting student number.we can simplify it first!
//principel=> (proffessor1 -> (teacher1(40) + teacher2(45))) + (proffessor2 -> (teacher3(23) + teacher4(60)))
//firstly the sum of two sum return to the proffessors;then the sum of two proffessors return it to the principel.


//A few points about recursion.
//Every recursive solution needs to have a base case --a condition to terminate the recursion.
/*recursion might simpify solving a problem but it does not
always translate to a faster solution . A recursive solution may be 
for worse compared to an iterative solution */

//recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. do not give up if you straggle with the concept!
