//Recursion:
//Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solution to smaller instance of the same problem.

//recurtion is when a function call itself!


//why recurtion?
//a great technique to simplify your solution.
//if you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem,recursion is very usefull.


//Analogy: if principal asked to two proffessor for getting student number.we can simplify it first!
//principel=> (proffessor1 -> (teacher1(40) + teacher2(45))) + (proffessor2 -> (teacher3(23) + teacher4(60)))
//firstly
