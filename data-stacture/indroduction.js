//before we begin:

//this course is a continution of the javascript algorithm series;
//different proggramming languages have different data staucture . our choise of the language will be javascript;
//it is possible to implement a data stucture in a few ways;
//please do not memorise the implementation;


//what is data structure?
//a data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used effciently;

//a data structure is a collection of data values , the relationships among them ,and  the functions or operations that can be applied to that data;

//why learn data structure?
// almost every applicationwe build involves data that is modelled in a certain way to effciently manage that data ,you need data structure;
//imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no affecient organization of the books and they are stored randomly;
//data structure help us solve problem in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory;

//learning about data structure also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of.

//for example:
//DOM is contained a = Tree Data Structure;
//Browser back and forword button= Stack data stracture;
//OS jab scheduling = Queue data structure;
