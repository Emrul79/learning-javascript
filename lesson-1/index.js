// document.getElementById() //console.log();
//In the above sentance the ** getElementById() ** and ** log()** both are method(functions) of document and console object{}!!
//whenever we call those method they take an argument or deta to work with.
// it works like, the methode is cheap or cooker. the argument you give is like ingredients.
//then it will return you delicioue resipie otherwise it will return nothing!

//  DOM = Document - Object - Model. //when someone talk about DOM ,don't be sceard .just  translated to how to use javascript to modify your website.

//we will learn this 3 thing separately.
//1.Document: what we will interect with is a HTML document.
//2.Object: it just take the HTML document and show the JavaScript Object.
//  Document = { Object }.
//Model: Model is just a represntation or mobelation. its just the represntation of javascript of your html document.
//for example:
//Real Thing: <h1 id='myCounter'>this is a simple header</h1> ->
//Your JS Model : let myCounter= document.getElementById('myCounter');

//String vs Number: In a resling game between string & number-Number always win.
//for example:
// let mynumber = 65;
//let mystring= 'hi my name is biplob & i am ' + mynumber + 'years old'.
//so we can say that if a number added with a string this number will be convert into a string.

/*
(NUMBER VS STRING)

console.log(5 + '7');//output=57 | because number vs string = winner (string);
console.log('5' + "7");//output=57
console.log(5 + +"7");//output=12 | when we put a plus sing befoere a string , it will convert intu a number!!

console.log('5' + 7);//output=57



//Counter App End here 






//Create a function .add3points() and remove2points ,and have them. add and remove points from mypoints veriable.

let myPoints=0;

function add3points(){
    return myPoints += 3;
}
function remove2points() {
  return (myPoints -= 2);
}

add3points()//output=3;
add3points()//output=3+3||6
remove2points()//output=6-2||4
remove2points();//output=6-2-2||2
console.log(add3points());//output=2+3||5
